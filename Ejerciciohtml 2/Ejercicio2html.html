    <h2>When My Devil Rises</h2>
    <p>Massive corruption let it begin
        And hell with this air
        Time flies and it's making me choke
        
        Shut your mind down what does it take
        Confess your wrong conscience
        Justice What a big joke</p>

        <h3>Emotion</h3>
        <p>This is the message for tomorrow
            It's beginning of our new days
            Hope is all in ourselves
            I will rise bestir my self this time
            
            Without the light in dark
            But I feel the deepest emotions
            Throughout the fight with mind
            I don't care about the lapse</p>

        <h2>Evils fall</h2>
        <P>Run away right now
            Abandon this place with never looking back
            Alert clangs through the fear starts to rule
            Reign of insanity continues to attack
            
            Thick smog is around
            What I see what I fear the silence with a sound
            Slight bright eyes with ferocious lights
            Never have I had this feeling that surrounds</P>
